# Lane Runner Game Development Plan

## Core Requirements
- Web-based game that runs on localhost
- Lane-based running gameplay
- Controls: A/D keys + left/right gamepad input
- Player moves between lanes while running forward

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Game Structure
- HTML file with canvas element
- JavaScript game engine (vanilla JS or lightweight framework)
- CSS for basic styling

### 2. Game Mechanics
- Player character that auto-runs forward
- 3-5 lane system for left/right movement
- Obstacle generation and collision detection
- Score system based on distance/time

### 3. Input Handling
- Keyboard listeners for A (left) and D (right)
- Gamepad API integration for left/right directional input
- Smooth lane switching animations

### 4. Visual Elements
- Canvas-based rendering or CSS animations
- Simple sprites/shapes for player and obstacles
- Scrolling background to simulate forward movement
- UI elements for score display

### 5. Game Loop
- Update player position
- Generate and move obstacles
- Check collisions
- Update score and UI
- Handle game over states
